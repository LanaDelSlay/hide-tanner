## While bank not empty of hides. 

    ## Check if inventory has hides, and both runes store the results so we know wat to grab from bank.

        ## If Yes switch to magic tab.

        ## If No open bank -> Check if bank is on correct tab.

            ## If no click correct bank tab

            ## If Yes Continue to next statement

            ## Grab correct items as stored upon first starting.

            ## Exit bank then go to magic tab.

        ## Cast tan hide until hide is gone.

        ## ^^ Once clicked 5 times (Gets rid of 25/26 of the hides if having the runes in inv w/o rune pouch)

        ## Switch to inventory

        ## Check if any thing is missing

            ## If yes kill the script

            # If no (other than the obvious hides) continue restart
